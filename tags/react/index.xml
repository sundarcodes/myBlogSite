      <description>Ahh..I am sure you would have read umpteen number of blogs/articles comparing React, Angular (and Vue). Well this is going to be my version of it after having had a chance to work on both of them. I have to admit that I have done lot more projects in Angular than in React but I think got a good grasp on both of these to write about their similarities/differences.
For starters, both of them are used to build SPAs and good at what they are supposed to.</description>
