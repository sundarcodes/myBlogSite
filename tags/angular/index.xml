      <description>Ahh..I am sure you would have read umpteen number of blogs/articles comparing React, Angular (and Vue). Well this is going to be my version of it after having had a chance to work on both of them. I have to admit that I have done lot more projects in Angular than in React but I think got a good grasp on both of these to write about their similarities/differences.</description>

      <description>Angular the framework as this is what the Angular team would like to call, has evolved(and evolving) from being the most popular front end JavaScript framework over the last 5 years to a framework that has transformed itself to survive and be a leader for years to come. All references to Angular points to the version 2 and above and AngularJS means Angular 1.x.
In this post, we would be seeing how different is Angular and what are the new additions it is bringing to the world of Single Page App development.</description>
