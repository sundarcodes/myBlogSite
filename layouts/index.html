    <h1>Hello</h1>

    <p class='justify'>I am Sundar, a software engineer having close to decade and half years of experience in writing and developing network, system and web application softwares. Started my career as a C,C++ programmer, helped companies build network management softwares and later went on to build stock exchange management systems software. Moved to web and mobile app development over the few years and has absolutely enjoyed the transition since then. Have dabbled with machine learning in last few years. I love to mentor and build strong tech teams. To summarise, a polyglot programmer who loves to build <strong>teams</strong> and <strong>products</strong>. Currently, building products in AI/RPA domain.</p>

    <p class='justify'>Apart from coding, I love teaching and reading. I was a mentor in a programming bootcamp based
        out of India and enjoyed
        every bit of it. If you donâ€™t find me coding or reading, then you would either find me playing with my kids or
        helping out my wife setting up our home. But I have to admit that playing with my kids is the most fun of them
        all
        :)</p>

    <p class='justify'>Over the years, I got to realize that writing code is an art which is not just about solving
        a problem but more importantly to write in such a way people are able to read, understand, learn, appreciate
        and maintain it.
    </p>

    <p class='justify'>The <a href="/post">posts</a> are my own little way of sharing my knowledge and giving back to
        the community from where I have learned a
        lot. I also believe that knowledge is one of few commodities which when shared never decreases but on the
        contrary
        increases :) Would love to have your feedback, comments on my ramblings as its all based on my own little
        experiences..</p>
