    <h1>Hello</h1>

    <p class='justify'>I am Sundar, a software engineer having 12+ yrs of experience in writing and developing network, system and web application softwares.
        Started my career as a C,C++ programmer and has helped companies build network mangement softwares and later went
        on to build stock exchange management systems software. Moved to web and mobile app development over the last couple
        of years and has absolutely enjoyed the transition since then.</p>

    <p class='justify'>Apart from coding, I love teaching and reading. I was a mentor in a programming bootcamp based out of India and enjoyed
        every bit of it. If you donâ€™t find me coding or reading, then you would either find me playing with my daughter or
        helping out my wife setting up our home. But I have to admit that playing with my daughter is the most fun of them all
        :)</p>

    <p class='justify'>Over the years, I got to realize that writing code is an art which is not just about making the code work
        as per the expectations but more importantly to write in such a way people are able to read, understand and maintain it. 
    </p>

    <p class='justify'>The <a href="/post">posts</a> are my own little way of sharing my knowledge and giving back to the community from where I have learned a
        lot. I also believe that knowledge is one of few commodities which when shared never decreases but on the contrary
        increases :) Would love to have your feedback, comments on my ramblings as its all based on my own little experiences..</p>
