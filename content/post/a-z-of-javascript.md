This is my collection of A-to-Z terms that one should knowing if they are into serious javascript programming.

### **A**sync/**Await**
[Async][async] and [Await][await] are new features introduced in the language to make asynchronous code block look synchronous and more importantly make it more readable.

### **B**rendan Eich
[Brendan Eich][BrendanEich] is the creator of JavaScript. He created the language in a matter of 10 days when working for Netscape Navigator. Due credit to be given to him for creating this language.

### **C**losure/**C**allbacks
[Closures][closures] is one key aspect of the language which makes is support functional programming concepts and also very centric to its event driven approach to running code.

[Callbacks][callbacks] are functions passed as parameters to other functions more often to support asynchronous code execution.

### **D**ynamically Typed
JavaScript is a [dynamically][dynamic-typing] typed language - an advantage as well as a disadvantage

### **E**CMAScript/**E**ventLoop
JavaScript's official name is [ECMAScript][ECMAScript].
If you have to understand about [eventloop][event-loop], then you have to watch this [talk][philip-roberts].

### **F**unctional
JavaScript supports functional style of programming. If you want to learn more about this, you could read [here][functional-light].

### **G**enerators
[Generators][generators] are functions that could save context across re-entrances.

### **H**

### **I**IFE

### **J**SON

### **K**

### **L**

### **M**

### **N**ode

### **O**bjects

### **P**rototypal Inheritance

### **Q**

### **R**

### **S**ervice Worker

### **T**

### **U**

### **V**

### **W**eb Assembly/**W**eb Worker

### **X**

### **Y**
